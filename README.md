This project uses **Cloud Custodian (c7n)** to perform audits on AWS EC2 instances, specifically focusing on EBS volumes attached to EC2 instances. The audit checks for the encryption status of the attached EBS volumes and ensures that EC2 instances are compliant with security and encryption best practices.

## Features

- Audit AWS EC2 instances and their associated EBS volumes.
- Identify EC2 instances that have unencrypted EBS volumes.
- Automatically take action (e.g., terminate instances) based on policy compliance.

## Requirements

- **AWS CLI**: Make sure you have the AWS CLI installed and configured with the necessary credentials.
- **Python 3.x**: Cloud Custodian requires Python 3.x for installation and operation.
- **Cloud Custodian (c7n)**: This project utilizes Cloud Custodian for auditing.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SudevShibu/cloud-custodian-ec2-ebs-audit.git
   cd cloud-custodian-ec2-ebs-audit
2. Set up a virtual environment:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Install the required dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Install Cloud Custodian:
   pip install c7n

Usage

1. Create your Cloud Custodian policy in YAML format. For example:
   
   policies:
  - name: ec2-ebs-encryption
    description: |

    resource: aws.ec2
    filters:
      - type: ebs
        key: Encrypted
        value: false
    actions:
      - terminate

2. Validate the policy:
   custodian validate policy.yml

3. Run the policy:
   custodian run -s out policy.yml
